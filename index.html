    <h1>Antoine de Préville</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/253180_10150991041637821_1055029676_n.jpg" alt="My picture">
    <p>International mongrel, Antoine is born in San Salvador, El Salvador. A mother from Armenia and an Argentinian father, both French as well, makes Antoine speak French and Spanish. He now lives in Geneva, Switzerland as a Swiss citizen.
        In his childhood, Antoine had a passion for the great civilisations: Rome, Ancient Egypt and Greece. He studied Latin until he was sixteen, but science and the understanding of the environment guided his future. He studied environmental sciences at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne and at the University of Lausanne. Since then, he keeps trying to understand the world. He thinks IT can be a tool to do that.
        Antoine is also an artist trying to capture his surroundings with a camera. Also keen in reading and writing, he appreciates classical French, Latin-american and Russian literature.</p>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>
    <p>Antoine has the ability to improve what he does and does not take things for granted. He seeks to deliver quality work by focusing on the problem and finding the best solutions. For this, he needs to have a holistic view of a situation to take the best decisions after balancing what is good or what is bad. He is down to earth and persistant, hence pragmatic though rigorous. Cooperative more than competitive, Antoine « wants the team to win », but he does not seek to be the star.</p>
    <p>Due to his academic education, Antoine thinks different sources of information on facts are the best ways to get a balanced view of a situation. He likes to ask questions and he can make realistic suggestions to contribute to a solution. Process- and improvement-oriented, he cares about others in the team and thinks they should have the opportunity to do the best they can. He feels that the others need and should contribute with their questions or ideas. He values people for what they are and not for what they can bring to him. Sometimes, others perceive Antoine as an intellectual.</p>

    <h2>What Antoine values</h2>
    <h3>Personal development</h3>
    <p>Transcending oneself is achieved by continuous learning, discovering and taking new challenges. Curiosity and interest are needed to this end and thus allow to hustle one’s own limits.</p>
    <h3>Quality</h3>
    <p>It is what works and what is simple at the same time. With a few things it is possible to make a lot. ISO9000: « Tell what you will do, do what you said. » Einstein said: « Make things as simple as possible but not simpler. »</p>
    <h3>Creativity</h3>
    <p>Capacity to come up with innovative ideas or concepts to adress challenges.</p>
